## Git-Friendly Usage

### Daily Update Process
1. **Pull latest changes:** `git pull origin main`
2. **Scroll to bottom of "Daily Progress" section**
3. **Copy the template below:**

```markdown
#### YYYY-MM-DD (Day X of 14)

**Stories Completed Today:**
- Story X: {Story Name} - {SP} SP ✅

**Remaining Story Points:** {X} SP
**Ideal Remaining:** {Y} SP (from table above)
**Status:** 🟢 On Track | 🟡 At Risk | 🔴 Behind Schedule

**Notes:**
- {Developer updates, progress notes, blockers discovered}
```

4. **Fill in today's data**
5. **Paste at the bottom of "Daily Progress" section (append-only!)**
6. **Update the "Actual Remaining" column in the Burndown Data table**
7. **Commit:** `git add burndown.md && git commit -m "chore: update burndown for Day X"`
8. **Push:** `git push origin main`

### Why Append-Only?
- Multiple developers can update on the same day without conflicts
- Git will merge chronological entries automatically
- Historical data is never overwritten
- Easy to see progress over time

### Alternative: One Update Per Day
- Designate one person (rotating daily) to update burndown at end of day
- Others update their individual standups and story files
- Reduces chance of any merge conflicts
