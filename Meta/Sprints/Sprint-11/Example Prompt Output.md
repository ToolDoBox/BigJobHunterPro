## PART A) Pre-Contemplation

You’re writing a short post-interview thank-you to Tim, with two extra jobs: (1) extend thanks to the rest of the team you met, and (2) ask about decision timing without sounding anxious or pushy.

Key moves that matter here:

- Name the team members so it feels personal (and so Tim can forward it easily).
- Keep the praise specific but light (“thoughtful questions,” “enjoyed meeting everyone”), not a recap of the whole interview.
- Ask the timeline question as a process question (“next steps / decision timeline”) and, if useful, add an “if I should follow up” option.
- Match your stated tone: warm, enthusiastic, straightforward, and not long.
- Avoid a formal “Dear,” avoid the “hope you’re well” opener, and end cleanly with your signature.

Assumptions I’m making:

- This email is going to Tim only (since you don’t have the other emails yet).
- You want Tim to pass along your thanks, and optionally introduce you to the team via email if appropriate.
- You want a subject line that’s simple and normal in a hiring process.

## PART B) The Solution

### 1) Rhetorical situation summary

- **Audience:** Tim Ochs (team lead / hiring manager), with an explicit nod to Walter, Cameron, Moises, and Blessing.
- **Purpose:** Thank them for their time; reinforce interest; request a rough timeline for hearing back.
- **Medium:** Email.
- **Tone/Style:** Warm, enthusiastic, straightforward; short and simple.

### 2) Ideas organized into an outline

1. Greeting to Tim
2. Quick thanks + one concrete positive (meeting team / thoughtful questions)
3. Extend thanks to the team by name and ask him to pass it along
4. Timeline question (one sentence)
5. Signature

### 3) Rough draft

Hi Tim,

Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me today. I really enjoyed the conversation and appreciated how thoughtful the team’s questions were.

Please extend my thanks to Walter, Cameron, Moises, and Blessing as well—I enjoyed meeting everyone.

When do you expect to have an update on next steps or a decision?

### 5) Final draft

Hi Tim,

Thank you for the time today. I enjoyed the conversation and appreciated the team’s thoughtful questions, and answers.

If you’re able, please pass my thanks along to Walter, Cameron, Moises, and Blessing—I enjoyed meeting everyone (and I hope I got everyone’s names spelled correctly).

What does your timeline look like for next steps or a decision?

### Different ways to frame the “when will I hear back” question (pick one)

1. **Most direct:** “When do you expect to have an update on next steps or a decision?”
2. **Process-oriented:** “What does the rest of your process look like from here?”
3. **Low-pressure follow-up:** “If I haven’t heard anything, when would be a good time for me to follow up?”
4. **Gives flexibility:** “Do you have a rough sense of timing for next steps?”
5. **If you want a date anchor:** “Are you aiming to wrap up decisions this week, or is it likely to run into next week?”

If you want, I can also write a version that lightly asks Tim to intro you to the team by email (so you can thank them directly) without making it awkward.
