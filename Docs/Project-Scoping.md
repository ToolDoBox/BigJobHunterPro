**Status:** Scoping & Planning Phase

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document defines the feature scope, user stories, and implementation roadmap for Big Job Hunter Pro—a collaborative gamified job tracking application built by and for a friend group of developers experiencing job search burnout.

**Key Context:**
- **Origin:** Friend group collaboration solving immediate, lived problem (not hypothetical future users)
- **Existing System:** Job-Hunt-Context (24+ applications tracked, sophisticated JSON schemas, but fundamentally solo)
- **Core Innovation:** Social accountability + gamification (hunting parties, leaderboards, competitive motivation)
- **Timeline:** Aggressive 4-week Phase 1 (we need this working NOW)

---

## TASK FLOW ANALYSIS

Walking through the user's journey from job search frustration to successful job placement, identifying pain points and opportunities for Big Job Hunter Pro to add value.

### TASK FLOW 1: Logging a New Job Application

**Scenario:** A friend group member finds a job posting on Indeed/LinkedIn and wants to log it quickly before continuing their application spree.

**Current Workflow (Job-Hunt-Context):**
1. Find job posting on job board
2. Copy job details (company, title, URL, skills required)
3. Open code editor or file manager
4. Create new JSON file with naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-company-role.json`
5. Copy JSON schema template
6. Manually fill 50+ fields (company info, role details, skills, requirements, compensation)
7. Save file to `04-Applications/Open/` folder
8. Refresh localhost:8000 dashboard to see update
9. **Total time: 5-10 minutes**
10. **Friction point: Too slow when applying to 10+ jobs per day**

**Target Workflow (Big Job Hunter Pro):**
1. Find job posting on job board
2. Click "Quick Capture" button (or keyboard shortcut)
3. Fill 3 essential fields: Company, Role Title, Source URL
4. Click "Lock & Load" (+1 point feedback appears instantly)
5. **Total time: 15 seconds**
6. Optional: Add skills/requirements/notes later via application detail view
7. See leaderboard update immediately (competitive feedback)
8. **Happy Path:** User logs 10 applications in 2.5 minutes, feels accomplished, sees leaderboard position improve

**Steps Breakdown:**
1. **Trigger:** User finds job posting worth tracking
2. **Action:** Open Quick Capture modal (hotkey or button)
3. **Input:** Company name (autocomplete), Role title, Source URL
4. **Submit:** Click "Lock & Load"
5. **Feedback:** +1 point animation, score updates, leaderboard refreshes
6. **Result:** Application logged, user returns to job search

**Decision Points:**
- Should I add detailed info now or later? (Later = faster)
- Should I tag skills immediately? (Optional, can add later)

**Obstacles:**
- Autocomplete doesn't find company → Manual entry fallback
- Duplicate application warning → User chooses to skip or override
- Internet connection lost → Offline queue with retry

**Simplification Opportunities:**
- Pre-fill company info from URL (if browser extension active)
- Auto-tag skills from job description (Phase 4: AI parsing)
- Save draft applications for multi-step forms

---

### TASK FLOW 2: Checking Leaderboard & Getting Motivated

**Scenario:** A friend group member is feeling burnt out after receiving two rejection emails. They need a motivation boost to keep applying.

**Current Workflow (Job-Hunt-Context):**
1. Receive rejection email
2. Feel demotivated, consider giving up for the day
3. Open localhost:8000 dashboard (if remembered)
4. See beautiful charts showing progress
5. Feel slightly better but still isolated (no one else sees this progress)
6. **Pain Point:** Charts don't prevent motivation decay—no external accountability

**Target Workflow (Big Job Hunter Pro):**
1. Receive rejection email
2. Open Big Job Hunter Pro (muscle memory from daily streak habit)
3. Log rejection via Quick Capture (+5 points for resilience)
4. See **Rivalry Panel:** "Jordan is 12 points ahead. They have 2 more interviews than you. Close the gap: apply to 3 more jobs today!"
5. Check **Hunting Party Leaderboard:** See friend just overtook your #3 position
6. Feel competitive spark: "I can catch up"
7. **Activity Feed:** "Alex just landed an interview at Google! +5 pts"
8. Feel part of a team; celebrate friend's win
9. Apply to 3 more jobs to close the gap
10. **Happy Path:** Rejection reframed as +5 points; rivalry motivates action instead of demotivation

**Steps Breakdown:**
1. **Trigger:** User opens app (daily habit or after rejection)
2. **Dashboard View:** Personal stats + Hunting Party sidebar
3. **Rivalry Panel:** Shows user directly above, exact gap, actionable nudge
4. **Leaderboard:** Top 10 list, current user highlighted
5. **Activity Feed:** Recent party member wins/milestones
6. **Decision:** Apply to more jobs OR check analytics to optimize strategy

**Decision Points:**
- Check personal stats or leaderboard first? (Dashboard shows both)
- React to rivalry panel nudge? (Close the gap vs. ignore)
- Celebrate friend's win or feel FOMO? (Positive reinforcement culture)

**Obstacles:**
- Leaderboard shows user in last place → Could be demotivating
  - **Mitigation:** Rivalry panel focuses on "next person up" not #1 leader
  - **Mitigation:** Multiple leaderboards (weekly reset, most improved, resilience champion)
- No friends online → Activity feed is stale
  - **Mitigation:** Show personal achievements, historical milestones

---

### TASK FLOW 3: Updating Application Status After Interview

**Scenario:** A friend group member just completed a first-round interview and wants to log the progression and celebrate the milestone.

**Current Workflow (Job-Hunt-Context):**
1. Complete interview
2. Open file manager, navigate to application JSON file
3. Edit `timeline_events` array, add new event:
   ```json
   {
     "event_type": "interview",
     "stage": "interview",
     "timestamp": "2026-01-04T14:30:00Z",
     "notes": "Went well, discussed React project"
   }
   ```
4. Update `status_stage` to `"interview"`
5. Save file
6. Refresh localhost:8000 to see Sankey diagram update
7. **Total time: 2-3 minutes**
8. **Pain Point:** No celebration, no one knows, no points earned

**Target Workflow (Big Job Hunter Pro):**
1. Complete interview
2. Open Big Job Hunter Pro mobile PWA (on commute home)
3. Tap application in list, tap "Update Status"
4. Select "Interview 1 Completed" from dropdown
5. (Optional) Add quick notes via voice input
6. Tap "Update"
7. **Confetti animation:** "Interview Complete! +5 points!"
8. **Achievement Unlocked:** "First Interview" badge appears
9. **Leaderboard Updates:** See position improve from #4 to #3
10. **Activity Feed Post:** "Chris just completed an interview at Infosys! 🎯"
11. Friend group members see update, send encouraging messages
12. **Happy Path:** Milestone celebrated publicly, points earned, motivation sustained

**Steps Breakdown:**
1. **Trigger:** Interview completed (real-world event)
2. **Action:** Open app, navigate to application detail
3. **Update:** Change status via dropdown or quick action
4. **Feedback:** +5 points, achievement unlock, confetti
5. **Social:** Activity feed broadcasts win to hunting party
6. **Result:** Progress logged, team celebrates, user feels accomplished

**Decision Points:**
- Add detailed notes about interview or skip? (Optional)
- Share company name in activity feed or keep private? (Privacy settings)

**Obstacles:**
- Forgot to log interview → Reminder notifications (opt-in)
- Multiple interview rounds confusing → Interview 1, 2, 3, 4+ auto-numbered
- Privacy concerns → Company names hidden, only "completed interview" shown

---

### TASK FLOW 4: Importing Existing Applications from Job-Hunt-Context

**Scenario:** Friend group member (Christian) has 24 applications tracked in Job-Hunt-Context JSON files and wants to migrate to Big Job Hunter Pro without losing historical data.

**Current Workflow (Manual Migration - Nightmare Scenario):**
1. Export each JSON file
2. Copy-paste company, role, skills into new system
3. Manually recreate timeline events
4. **Total time: 10-15 minutes × 24 applications = 4-6 hours**
5. **Pain Point:** Absolutely unacceptable; would abandon tool

**Target Workflow (Big Job Hunter Pro - Import Tool):**
1. Navigate to Settings → Import Data
2. Drag-and-drop all 24 JSON files from Job-Hunt-Context folder
3. Click "Import & Calculate Points"
4. **System Processing:**
   - Parse JSON schema v1
   - Map to Big Job Hunter Pro entities
   - Extract timeline_events for Sankey diagram
   - Calculate retroactive points (Applied +1, Interview +5, Rejection +5)
   - Import skills, company data, requirements
5. Progress bar: "Importing 24 applications... 100%"
6. **Success Screen:** "Imported 24 applications! You've earned 47 points from past work!"
7. Dashboard loads with full history, Sankey diagram shows pipeline
8. **Total time: 2 minutes**
9. **Happy Path:** All historical data preserved, points credited, ready to use immediately

**Steps Breakdown:**
1. **Trigger:** New user onboarding (friend group member)
2. **Action:** Access import tool
3. **Upload:** Bulk file selection or drag-and-drop
4. **Processing:** Schema mapping, validation, point calculation
5. **Review:** Preview imported data (optional dry-run)
6. **Confirm:** Execute import
7. **Feedback:** Success message, point total displayed
8. **Result:** Full history migrated, user starts from running start

**Decision Points:**
- Import all at once or incrementally? (All at once preferred)
- Override existing data or merge? (First import = clean slate)
- Review each application or trust import? (Dry-run preview option)

**Obstacles:**
- JSON schema mismatch → Version detection + mapping rules
- Duplicate applications detected → User chooses to skip or override
- Timeline events out of order → Auto-sort by timestamp
- Missing required fields → Use sensible defaults, flag for review

**Simplification Opportunities:**
- One-click import from GitHub repo (friend group shares repo)
- Batch edit imported applications (update skills across multiple)
- Export back to JSON (bidirectional sync for backup)

---

### TASK FLOW 5: Friend Group Weekly Retrospective

**Scenario:** Friend group schedules weekly Sunday evening check-ins to review progress, share learnings, and set weekly challenges.

**Current Workflow (Ad-hoc Discord/Zoom):**
1. Jump on Discord voice call
2. Each person manually reports: "I applied to 7 jobs, got 1 interview"
3. Someone takes notes in shared Google Doc
4. Discuss what's working: "Indeed seems better than LinkedIn"
5. Set informal goals: "Let's all apply to 10 jobs this week"
6. **Pain Point:** No structured data, relies on memory, goals aren't tracked

**Target Workflow (Big Job Hunter Pro - Group Retrospective):**
1. Open Big Job Hunter Pro "Hunting Party" tab
2. Click "Weekly Retrospective" (auto-generated report)
3. **System Shows:**
   - **Group Stats:** 32 applications, 4 interviews, 2 rejections this week
   - **Top Performer:** Jordan (12 applications, 2 interviews)
   - **Most Improved:** Chris (+8 applications vs. last week)
   - **Resilience Champion:** Alex (logged 3 rejections, kept applying)
   - **Source Analysis:** Indeed (18 apps, 3 interviews) vs. LinkedIn (14 apps, 1 interview)
   - **Skill Gaps:** "React" mentioned in 8 rejections → Consider upskilling
4. Group discusses insights on call, references dashboard live
5. **Weekly Challenge:** "Everyone apply to 10 jobs by Friday"
6. System tracks challenge progress (progress bars for each member)
7. Friday: Notification "Challenge ends in 24 hours! You're at 7/10 applications"
8. **Happy Path:** Data-driven retrospective, collaborative goal-setting, accountability via challenge tracking

**Steps Breakdown:**
1. **Trigger:** Weekly scheduled time (Sunday evening)
2. **Preparation:** System auto-generates retrospective report
3. **Review:** Group reviews stats together (screen share)
4. **Discussion:** Identify patterns, celebrate wins, discuss obstacles
5. **Goal-Setting:** Create weekly challenge in system
6. **Tracking:** Dashboard shows challenge progress throughout week
7. **Result:** Structured accountability, data-driven optimization

**Decision Points:**
- Create new challenge or extend existing? (Fresh start each week)
- Individual goals or collective goal? (Both supported)
- Share retrospective publicly or keep private? (Party-only)

**Obstacles:**
- Not everyone participates → Progress bars show who's behind (friendly pressure)
- Challenge too aggressive → Adjust mid-week (flexible editing)
- Timezone differences → Async retrospective comments

## DEFINE THE MINIMAL VIABLE PROJECT (MVP)

### 1. Prioritized Goals (20% that solves 80% of the problem)

**Core Problem:** Friend group experiencing job search burnout due to isolation, lack of motivation, and tracking friction.

**20% of Goals:**
1. **Enable fast application logging** (Quick Capture in 15 seconds)
2. **Create competitive social accountability** (Hunting parties + leaderboards)
3. **Preserve existing work** (Import Job-Hunt-Context data with retroactive points)
4. **Gamify effort** (Points for applications, interviews, AND rejections)
5. **Show progress visibly** (Dashboard with score, rank, activity feed)

These 5 goals solve:
- ✅ **Isolation** → Hunting parties + leaderboards create visibility
- ✅ **Motivation decay** → Points + rivalry panel drive daily action
- ✅ **Tracking friction** → 15-second Quick Capture vs. 5-10 minute JSON editing
- ✅ **Data migration** → Import 24 existing applications without loss
- ✅ **Burnout** → Rejections earn +5 points, reframing failure as progress

---

### 2. Prioritized Features (DO NOW Quadrant)

**Phase 1 MVP Features (14 User Stories):**

**Authentication (2):**
- US-001: User Registration
- US-002: User Login

**Core Tracking (6):**
- US-004: Quick Capture (15-second promise)
- US-005: View Application List
- US-006: Application Detail View
- US-007: Update Application Status
- US-009: Add/Edit Notes
- US-011: Earn Points for Actions
- US-012: View Total Score

**Social/Collaborative (5):**
- US-018: Create Hunting Party
- US-019: Generate Invite Link
- US-020: Join Hunting Party
- US-021: Leaderboard (All-Time)
- US-023: Rivalry Panel
- US-024: Activity Feed (Party)

**Import/Export (2):**
- US-026: Import Job-Hunt-Context JSON
- US-027: Retroactive Point Calculation

**Total: 16 User Stories, ~68 Story Points** (4 weeks @ 17 points/week)

---

### 3. Check Goals - Missing Features?

**Goal 1: Fast Logging** → ✅ US-004 (Quick Capture)
**Goal 2: Social Accountability** → ✅ US-018, 019, 020, 021, 023, 024 (Hunting parties + leaderboards)
**Goal 3: Preserve Existing Work** → ✅ US-026, 027 (Import with retroactive points)
**Goal 4: Gamify Effort** → ✅ US-011, 012 (Points system + score display)
**Goal 5: Show Progress** → ✅ US-012, 021, 024 (Score, leaderboard, activity feed)

**All prioritized goals covered.** ✅

---

### 4. Remove Unnecessary Features from MVP

**Removed from Phase 1 (Defer to Phase 2-3):**
- ❌ US-008: Timeline Events → Complex, not essential for MVP
- ❌ US-013: Daily Streaks → Gamification enhancement, defer to Phase 2
- ❌ US-015: Achievement Badges → Defer to Phase 2
- ❌ US-022: Weekly Leaderboard → Start with all-time, add weekly in Phase 3
- ❌ US-031: Sankey Diagram → Valuable but complex; Phase 2 priority
- ❌ US-032: Source Attribution → Meta-analysis for Phase 2

**Reasoning:** These features are important long-term but not critical for solving the core problem (isolation + motivation + tracking friction). MVP must ship in 4 weeks; these can follow in Phases 2-3.

---

### 5. MVP Scope Statement

**Big Job Hunter Pro MVP (Phase 1) Scope:**

Big Job Hunter Pro Phase 1 delivers a collaborative gamified job tracker that enables friend groups to:
1. **Log applications in 15 seconds** via Quick Capture (company, role, source)
2. **Import existing data** from Job-Hunt-Context (24+ applications with retroactive points)
3. **Create hunting parties** and invite friends via shareable links
4. **Compete on leaderboards** (all-time rankings by total points)
5. **View rival progress** via rivalry panel showing who's directly ahead and how to close the gap
6. **Celebrate together** via activity feed broadcasting wins (interviews, offers, achievements)
7. **Earn points for effort** (Applied +1, Interview +5, Rejection +5, Offer +50)
8. **Track applications** in a master list with detail view and status updates

**What's NOT in MVP:**
- Daily streaks (Phase 2)
- Achievement badges (Phase 2)
- Sankey diagrams (Phase 2)
- Weekly leaderboards (Phase 3)
- Browser extension (Phase 4)
- AI features (Future)

**Success Criteria:**
- Friend group (4-6 people) imports existing 24+ applications
- First hunting party created and active
- 30+ new applications logged in Week 4 of launch
- Leaderboard drives competition (confirmed via friend group feedback)

- ✅ Skill tagging (required/nice-to-have per application)

**Story Points:** 89
**Focus:** Automation (browser extension) + AI assistance + Polish

---

### NEVER WORKING ON (Too Complex or Low Value)

**Deferred Indefinitely:**
- ❌ Email integration (auto-log from Gmail) - Too complex (Story Points: 21)
- ❌ AI job matching (suggest roles) - Requires massive dataset (Story Points: 21)
- ❌ Referral network (connect with employees) - Social networking scope creep
- ❌ Salary data aggregation - Privacy/legal concerns
- ❌ Interview recording transcription - Audio processing complexity
- ❌ Mood tracking correlation - Niche use case, adds clutter

**Reasoning:** These features either:
1. Require months of development (email integration, AI matching)
2. Introduce legal/privacy risks (salary data, interview recordings)
3. Don't align with core mission (social accountability for friend groups)
4. Can be achieved via external tools (Levels.fyi for salary, Otter.ai for transcription)

## ROADMAP SUMMARY (Gantt Chart)

```
Phase 1 (MVP)           ████████████████ (4 weeks) Feb 2-Feb 29
  └─ Story Points: 68

Phase 2 (Gamification)          ████████████████ (4 weeks) Mar 2-Mar 29

  └─ Story Points: 89
```

**Total Roadmap:** 16 weeks to "feature-complete" v2.5
**Critical Path:** Phase 1 (friend group needs this NOW)

---

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Phase 1 Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** Import tool breaks with schema mismatches
**Mitigation:** Extensive testing with friend group's 24 files; dry-run preview mode

**Risk:** Leaderboard queries are too slow (LINQ performance)
**Mitigation:** Database indexing on `UserId`, `HuntingPartyId`, `Points`; caching for 5 minutes

**Risk:** Friend group abandons tool if Phase 1 takes >4 weeks
**Mitigation:** Ship hunting party + leaderboard by Week 3 even if import isn't ready

**Risk:** Rivalry panel demotivates instead of motivates
**Mitigation:** Show "next person up" not "#1 leader"; opt-out option; positive framing

### Technical Debt Allowances

**Acceptable Shortcuts in Phase 1:**
- ✅ All-time leaderboard only (no weekly reset) - Add in Phase 3
- ✅ Simple rivalry panel (just points gap) - Enhance in Phase 3
- ✅ Basic activity feed (no filters) - Polish in Phase 2
- ✅ Mobile-responsive but not PWA - PWA in Phase 4

**NOT Acceptable:**
- ❌ Skipping import tool (friend group blocker)
- ❌ Skipping hunting parties (core differentiator)
- ❌ Slow Quick Capture (breaks 15-second promise)

## CONCLUSION

This Project Scoping document defines a clear path from concept to shipped product:

1. **Task Flow Analysis** identified 5 critical workflows (logging apps, checking leaderboards, updating status, importing data, retrospectives)
2. **Brainstorming** generated 100 potential features across tracking, gamification, social, analytics, automation
3. **User Stories** converted 58 priority features into actionable stories with importance/feasibility ratings
