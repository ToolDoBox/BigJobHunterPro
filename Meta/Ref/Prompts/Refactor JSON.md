We are about have our .0 version go into production however there are some core changes that need to take place in order have long term support growth for the data aspects of this project because of how complex it is for us to publish new version and to maintain the database and different layers on that we want to make sure that we're not going to have to redo or try to retrofit anything in the future So we need to make a few changes to the way that we are handling application data and our applic details interface.

We're gonna want to have the ability to add certain statistics and analytics in the future in order to do so we're gonna need some specific pieces of information Some data that might be helpful is percentage of applications that reach the interview stage percentage of applications that get rejected the amount of time it takes from applying to rejection the amount of time from application to interview and we won't be able to compare our hunter groups with these types of stacks so we might be able to say this one player has the highest percentage of interviews to applications That might be some interesting statistics that'll be fun to play with in production the other thing is that at our current system for the status of applications it is a simple drop down things can only be at one status at a time which means that if we have had an interview and we made it to the interview stage We get rejected after that We don't have any history of having had done the interview with this current design.

Rather than a status being based on a single drop down we want statuses to be like timeline events that we can add notes and things to so you start off with the either prospecting or Applied status prospecting as you're adding it but have yet not yet applied to it applied is that you've applied to the position and then from there we can add timeline events so we can add a new event called screening that might be a recruiter reaching out HR reaching out doing a quick call or quick email survey or something like that This would currently show as a status of screening because that's the most recent status and we should get an additional point for that so rather than our current point system which is just a single application is only worth so many points and if you start with the applied and then go to interviewed your point value for that application goes from 1 to 5 rather than it being additive So what we're going to want to change it to is for each timeline event we add up those points O if you get an application in that's one If you do a prospect that's zero points you're just looking. If you applied and got a screening email or call The screening is worth two points in total you have three points for this application if you have applied a screening and an interview now you're worth eight points because interviews are worth 5 and for each additional interview it's worth 5O if we get to the second round interview then that would be worth 13 points because you have one for applied two for screening and five for the first interview and five for the second interview so we want to make sure that we update our system to account for this because we also want to see for interviews and other statistics around that how long it takes to get to that point as well as not have it be binary for what status we're currently in We want to treat this more like the timeline events that are based in our example: @Meta\Ref\2025-11-23-american-auto-auction-group-junior-devops-engineer.json Notice how in this example for the timeline events there are notes and timestamps that allow us to go back and review what was discussed previously this is helpful for both the end user as they applying to multiple places keeping their facts straight for the different interviews that they've gone through as well as helpful for keeping track of notes and other statistics around the interview process.

Your task is to go through the entire project review both the front end and the back end Plan out a change and implement that change Use the Chrome MCP tools as necessary in order to test that things are working properly Make sure that you start up the server or kill other processes as needed in order to ensure that you are able to test. Start by following our branching methodology in order to work on this refactor.
