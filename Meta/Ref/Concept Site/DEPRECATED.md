# DEPRECATED

This static HTML/CSS concept site is **archived reference only**.

## Status

**Deprecated as of January 2026**

The static concept site has been superseded by the React landing page at:
```
bigjobhunterpro-web/src/pages/Landing.tsx
```

## Why Deprecated

1. **Maintenance burden** - Maintaining two landing pages creates inconsistency
2. **React integration** - The React landing page integrates with the app's routing and build system
3. **Feature parity** - Landing V2 includes all features from the concept site plus screenshot gallery, expanded features, and scroll animations

## What to Use Instead

For landing page development:
- **Source**: `bigjobhunterpro-web/src/pages/Landing.tsx`
- **Styles**: `bigjobhunterpro-web/src/index.css`
- **Screenshots**: `bigjobhunterpro-web/public/screenshots/`

## Historical Reference

The files in this directory (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) represent the original concept design exploration. They may be useful for:
- Understanding early design decisions
- Referencing specific CSS patterns
- Historical context

**Do not update these files.** All landing page changes should go to the React implementation.
