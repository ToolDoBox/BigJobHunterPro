# Sprint {N} Plan

## Sprint Details

- **Sprint Number:** {N}
- **Start Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **End Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Duration:** {X} days ({Y} weeks)
- **Sprint Goal:** {High-level objective for this sprint}

## Team Capacity

| Developer | Available Days | Velocity (SP/day) | Total Capacity (SP) |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Dev 1     | {X}            | {Y}               | {Z}                 |
| Dev 2     | {X}            | {Y}               | {Z}                 |
| **Total** | **{X}**        | -                 | **{Z}**             |

> **Note:** If this is your first sprint, estimate conservatively (3-5 SP per developer). Use actual velocity from previous sprints to calculate capacity for subsequent sprints.
