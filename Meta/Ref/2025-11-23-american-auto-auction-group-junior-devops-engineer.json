Tim previously started Liquid Motors (retail + wholesale B2B car auction website/service) which was acquired after ~16 years by American Auto Auctions Group; the company has expanded to 50+ auctions. Current production system includes ~20-year-old C code with hand-written libraries and minimal external dependencies; they are implementing a new stack alongside the old using a strangler pattern. Current/newer stack includes C# on .NET 8 with ASP.NET API controllers, scheduled CLI tools, and substantial queue services/processing. Team is ~5 people total (Tim, 2 senior developers, 1 junior developer, 1 DBA). Goals include compartmentalizing code, containerizing it for cloud platforms, and reducing technical debt (including cleaning up older abstractions where anticipated features were never implemented). Python is used for some development tools but not production code. There are ~52 integrations, 9 active, with distinct retail vs wholesale business logic. Success in first 60–90 days: domain knowledge, architecture, business logic; longer-term: generalist contributor helping across the team. Role is fully remote; occasional optional Wednesday night bowling. Tim said candidate came across as passionate and indicated strong interest in continuing the process; Tim mentioned having ~5 interviews the same day and estimated ~10–20 candidates in total."

Candidate walked through a multi-rewrite personal project 'Toolbox' (front-end → Node.js API → React/TypeScript + Supabase) including a configurable journaling/form system with evolving inputs over time. Candidate discussed team workflow at All Kids Network (small team, partial agile practices; weekly/biweekly syncs, mostly async via Slack/email; handling long-form projects and urgent maintenance/security work). Candidate asked the panel about current source control/deployment workflow, presence of testing, rationale for opening the role, integration cadence (given ~52 integrations, ~9 active mentioned previously), and what success looks like for a collaborator in the first months vs long term; also asked about communication channels and remote-collaboration expectations."
