We want to update our app/dashboard with some more useful information: We want to have an analysis of the job descriptions that they have applied to. We want to review ALL of the positions they have applied for and have a keyword analysis of the Roles they have applied to, as well as a list of the most frequent skills that appear in these job descriptions. This information will allow our users to get an idea of any key skills they might be missing from their resume and help them to align their resume and job hunting with what they find is working. We want this new info section to be under the 'What's working' section, and have it be a new section above the 'Application Breakdown'

We also want to move the quick actions to the top, directly underneath the 'Welcome to the lodge' sign.
