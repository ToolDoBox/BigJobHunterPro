## Project Structure
- `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` implement the landing page.
- `imgs/` contains screenshots and brand assets referenced by the HTML.
- `Meta/Docs/` holds strategy, scope, and architecture planning notes.
- `Meta/Ref/` stores reference artifacts and archival planning notes.
- `Meta/Sprints/` contains sprint planning, backlog, and templates.
- If you need a new Markdown file that does not fit an existing category, place it in `Meta/` (misc bucket, but do not create junk files).
