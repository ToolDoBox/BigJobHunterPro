## Template Usage Notes

### How to Use This Template
1. Copy this template daily: `cp templates/daily-standup-template.md Sprint-N/daily-standups/YYYY-MM-DD-yourname.md`
2. Fill it out in the morning (before standup) or at end of previous day
3. Takes 2-5 minutes to complete
4. Commit and push so team can read before/during standup meeting

### Git-Friendly Tips
- Each developer has their own file (no conflicts!)
- Use consistent name format: `2026-01-04-christian.md`, `2026-01-04-john.md`
- Files are dated, so they auto-sort chronologically
- Old standups serve as a progress journal

### Keep It Brief
- Focus on **facts** (what you did/will do), not long explanations
- Use bullet points, not paragraphs
- Link to story files for full context
- Update story files throughout the day, standup is just a summary

### Optional Sections
You can remove sections that aren't relevant for a particular day:
- No blockers? Delete that section
- No coordination needed? Skip it
- No wins? (There's always a win! Find one!)

### Async Standup Option
If doing async standups:
- Post this file in team chat or commit by 9 AM
- Read teammates' standups before starting work
- Comment on blockers or offer help in chat
