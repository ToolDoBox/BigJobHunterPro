So for a solid week now and have run into a few things that we need to address

Number one we have transitioned from just a free SQL database on Azure to a now paid for usage database we need to make sure that we're not abusing our SQL database and make sure that it is as lean as possible we want to start using things like caching and want to minimize how much we are reading from and writing to the Sequel database we still want to use it and leverage it however we don't want to have unnecessary reads and writes That way we can avoid having to pay a lot for this database because honestly we do not need it that much because most of the time we're either writing to it or reading from it and we're not modifying it as much. For this Brent we are going to be reviewing all of our Sequel calls to our database making sure that we are as optimized lean and efficient as possible to save us money right now we are quoted about $10 to $30 of monthly usage and we want to get that down to $5.

Number two on the application details page the Timeline event notes have a limit of 1000 characters these notes are great for when we are actively in their interview and writing down quick notes for questions and things like that and are very useful for when we are writing down the questions that are being asked of us as well as keynotes that they are mentioning the 1000 character limit does get in the way and needs to be expanded In addition while we are actively in the interview having the modal window be the only thing that we see for the timeline event is a bit difficult as we might want to reference other pieces of information including the job description details and stack and things like that So what we want to do is revise and refactor our UI design and our back end design so that our application details page takes into account the fact that we would like to use this actively during the interview.

Number three because we use these sets of context for each application's submission quite frequently when we're actively interviewing or applying it's useful to have a quick edit and quick export by default we should be in the edit mode that should already have been fixed and we should have the ability to quickly export the entire listing into a JASON file they should not require any AI usage and should be completely done locally in the browser we should make sure that it's integrated well with our number one priority for this Sprint which is to minimize our API SQL usage. The goal of this export is to get all of the data pertaining to the application itself and make sure that we can quickly export it so that we can get feedback ideas for questions that might be asked things for us to practice and review etcetera etcetera for job prep.

We might want to add a more informal Just Notes section that allows us to add other contexts that pertains to this specific application so if we have a interviewer or somebody email us with results from screening we can include that in somewhere as a part of this context and save it to our database but not have to read and write from it as much The goal is to have all of our context for individual application in one place so we can easily export it and use it in other places.

#4 We want to Keep track of when we are applying when we are getting screenings and how long it takes for a rejection we want these statistics to show up on our dashboard page in addition to these statistics we would like the following information a pie graph that shows the number of applications per source so when we have Indie .com for example or Dice.com we want a pie chart that shows the number of applications and what percentages for what source in addition we want a pie chart that shows the number of applications per each timeline event that they're at so the number of applications that are just applied that are at screening that are at rejected just so we can keep track of the number of applications in each. We also want to have an average time to listing that says average time to rejection average time to screening average time to interview etc
