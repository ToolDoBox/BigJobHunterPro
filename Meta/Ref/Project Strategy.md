## ELEVATOR PITCH:

Kick off your project with a crisp, compelling summary. This isn't about selling, it's about bringing clarity to your project's essence. Your elevator pitch distills your project into a digestible, intriguing snippet for you and others to understand it quickly.  
 This pitch is a dynamic tool. It gives initial direction but can evolve as your project does. If your project boasts multiple key benefits, choose the most universal for your pitch. It should be informative yet persuasive, sparking interest and understanding in its brevity.

For this step, imagine that you are explaining this project idea to a close friend. Write a short pitch for the project (2-3 sentences), and make sure to include the following:

1.) **Identify The Problem:** Clearly state the problem your project solves and why it's important to address it\[2\].

2.) **Present Your Solution:** Explain how your project solves the identified problem and what sets it apart from competitors\[2\].

3.) **Define Your Target Audience:** Describe who your project is designed for and how it meets their needs\[1,2,3\].

4.) **Share Key Benefits:** Highlight the most significant advantages your project offers to your target audience\[2\].

5.) **Importance:** Describe why this project is important to you, and how it impacts your life, or your values._Example Personal Website Pitch:_

My problem is that it is difficult to share my projects and ideas with my friends, family and potential clients. A personal website would allow me to be able to share new projects and blog posts with a single link. This could also be a great way to give potential clients and employers a look into my work ethic, personality and interests. Building this personal website project is important to me because I value keeping my friends and family up to date on my hobbies, projects and live events.

_Example Personal Productivity Tool Pitch:_

I like to use various tools, timers and applications to keep me organized with the time I spend on work, school and personal projects. The problem that I have is that there are too many different tools I am using, that could be simplified down to a single web application. This web app could help me track my time for freelance billing, Keep me accountable to take breaks and build in various techniques to help keep me focused throughout the day. This would be accomplished with a time tracking app that also allows me to track my time on specific tasks and with a built in pomodoro timer. This would be different from other time tracking tools because it would be focused around building a sustainable focus energy, rather than just billing time.

## 10 QUESTIONS TO ASK YOURSELF BEFORE YOU BEGIN YOUR PROJECT:

Now is the perfect time to reflect and ensure your project aligns with your motivations. If you're just building this project to solve a specific problem, research alternatives first. For projects you are taking on for fun, focus on what you love.

1.) **Project's goal:** What is it for \- learning, profit, fun, problem-solving, or a mix? Determine what motivates you.

2.) **Passion:** Do the project's objectives align with your interests and excite you?

3.) **Skill Development:** Are you using this project to learn new skills, or to improve the ones that you already have?

4.) **Potential Impact:** Do you believe in the project's value for the target audience? (Especially if you are the target audience)

5.) **Career Alignment:** Does the project match your long-term career goals?

6.) **Project Scope:** Is the extent of the project clear or are you expecting significant changes during development?

7.) **Value & Fulfillment:** Do you see this project as a rewarding experience?

8.) **Motivation:** Can you see yourself staying engaged and motivated throughout the project?  
9.) **Complexity:** Is the project manageable, or is it too complex for your current skillset? Your project should be challenging, yet feasible. If it's too complex, you may want to consider breaking it down or building up the skills to take it on later.

10.) **Enjoyment:** Will you have fun working on this project, or do you just want a custom solution to a problem?

_Example Personal Website Motivation:_

Before I continued planning to build my website from scratch, I did some research on alternatives I could use to solve the same problem. I found that I could use a site builder, like Wix, or Wordpress, to achieve similar results, or even create a blog like Wordpress.  
 Even though these solutions could have solved my problem, I felt that the challenge of building the website from scratch would be more rewarding. I would also get a chance to practice building and designing websites from scratch. I also could see this as a cheaper alternative to a paid website plan. I think that I can keep the complexity low enough to make it possible for me to take it on.

_Example Personal Productivity Tool Motivation:_

I am currently using a combination of 5 websites to make my daily workflow. I use a time tracking website, a habit tracking website, a todo list website, a pomodoro website, and a task timer website. There are some websites like trello that would allow me to use plugins to get the same functionality as 1 or 2 of my websites.  
 At the moment I think it may be too complex of a project to take on for me right now. It also seems like a time-consuming project, so I may want to simplify the scope before I start it. I will do more research and thinking before I start building a custom solution.

## PROJECT GOALS:

Establishing goals guides the direction of your project. View it as setting a destination before embarking on a journey. These goals should be focused on what you want the project to achieve. Don’t focus on how the project is going to reach this goal, focus on what you want the project to be able to do when you finish it. What does your project need to be able to do in order to consider it a success\[1,2,3\]?

1.) **Problem-solving:** What problems or challenges will this project address for users\[2,3\]?

2.) **Primary goals:** What are the main objectives you want to achieve with this project\[1,2,3\]?

3.) **Personal brand alignment:** How does this project align with your personal brand and style\[1\]?

4.) **Values & beliefs:** How does the project support your values and beliefs?

5.) **Long-term vision:** How does the project fit into your larger plan or vision?

6.) **User experience:** What kind of user experience do you aim to create with this project\[1,2\]?

_Example Personal Website Goals:_

In order for me to consider this personal website project a success it needs to be able to do the following:

\- Any projects or blog posts can be shared with a single, reliable, link.  
\- There is a way for friends and family members to get updates easily about new projects and updates to the website.  
\- The website leads to more connections and conversations with friends, family members and potential clients.  
\- The website does a good job of reflecting my personality, and showcasing my work to new visitors, clients and employers.

## COMPETITOR ANALYSIS:

If we want to create a unique project, we have to get an idea of what similar projects offer\[2\]. This can also be a great time to find inspiration for valuable features and ideas to incorporate into our project. While you should definitely look at similar projects and solutions, you may find a great deal of ideas from unrelated projects\[1,2\].  
 Pay attention to what people talk about when they review or critique a project. Find alternatives to the project you want to build, and look for reviews of those alternatives. You may find a treasure trove of best practices, and criticisms of what you are looking to create. You may also be able to identify some standards that will be helpful to follow when creating your project\[2\].  
 If you are creating this project as a custom solution to a problem you are facing, you may find that other people have run into similar problems. Do some research and see what others have done in order to solve similar or related problems.

1.) **Identify Competitors:** What are the competing organizations, projects, and services?

2.) **Users’ Criticisms:** What are the common criticisms or complaints about your competitors' products? How can you prevent these issues in your project?

3.) **Successful Features:** What do successful competitors do? What features and strategies excel in this area? How can you integrate or enhance them?  
_Example Personal Website Competitor Analysis:_

Competitors/Inspiration:  
a) Derek Sivers’ Website \[[https://sive.rs/](https://sive.rs/)\]  
b) Willem Pennings’ Website \[[https://willempennings.nl/](https://willempennings.nl/)\]  
c) Bryan Braun’s Website \[[https://www.bryanbraun.com/](https://www.bryanbraun.com/)\]  
d) Alex Hyett’s Website \[[https://www.alexhyett.com/](https://www.alexhyett.com/)\]  
e) Rodolpho Arruda’s Website \[[https://rodolphoarruda.pro.br/about/](https://rodolphoarruda.pro.br/about/)\]

Criticisms/Praise:  
I couldn’t find very many other visitors' criticisms or praise for these websites, so I will list my own thoughts. (Note: If you are the author of one of these websites, your a really inspiring individual and I hope you have a great day :) )

_Derek Sivers’ Website:_  
I have a hard time giving too much criticism to this site, because the extremely minimalist design is part of the personality and charm. Anything that I may consider “missing” from the site, was probably not needed anyway. (Additionally, sites \[c,e\] cite _Sirvers’_ Website as an inspiration)

\+ Big fan of the message and personality that is very self evident when going through the site  
\+ Very clean and thoughtful “about me”, includes a “Me in 10 seconds” and a “Me in 10 minutes”  
\+ Extremely detailed and organized  
\- Navigation is a little difficult, a sitemap or index would be helpful (However the amount of context dependent links seems to make up for it)  
Features:  
Below are a list of the features and design ideas that I thought were particularly interesting:

\- About me in under a minute \[a,c,d,e\]  
\- Detailed about me \[a,b,d,e\]  
\- Contact me (form, or email) \[a,b,c,d,e\]  
\- Projects Page \[a,b,c,e\]  
\- A “Now” Page \[a,e\]  
\- Search \[b,d,e\]  
\- Blog/Article List \[a,b,c,d,e\]  
\- Site Index \[e\]  
\- Top Posts/Projects \[a,b,c,e\]  
\- Public Site Traffic Metric \[e\]  
\- Newsletter \[c,d\]  
\- Book Notes/Reviews \[a,c,d,e\]  
\- Current Tech/Tools \[a,d,e\]  
\- Light/Dark Mode \[b,d\]  
\- Social Media Links \[b,c,d,e\]  
\- “In the media” section \[b\]

Note: I should also mention that I had a bit of a bias when selecting and reviewing these websites. These websites were some of my favorites that I had found over the years, and all follow a similar pattern or schema. I would recommend also finding 1-2 sources of inspiration outside of your typical biased selections. I have a running list of about 20 sites I find interesting, which were not included in the list above.

## UNDERSTAND YOUR USERS:

Unless you are building this project for _only_ yourself, someone else is going to need to navigate and use your project. The better you understand who these users are, and what they are looking for out of your project, the better decisions you will make when designing and developing your project\[1,2,3\].  
 Creating a user persona helps keep these individuals in mind during your project's design and development\[1\]. Take time to understand your users: What challenges are they facing? What are their needs, preferences, and tech-savviness\[1,2\]?  
 Keep in mind, each user arrives at your project with a specific goal in mind\[2,3\]. So, your goal is to pinpoint your target user and discern their objectives when they visit your project.

1.) **Target Audience:** Who is your target audience? Consider their age range, gender, background, and interests\[1,2,3\].

2.) **Create Personas:** Develop detailed user personas, including age, job, favorite sites, technical profile, needs, and challenges\[1,2\].

3.) **Humanize Personas:** Bring your personas to life by assigning names and photos, helping you keep users in mind throughout the design and development process\[1\].

4.) **User’s Challenges:** Identify the difficulties your users currently face and the challenges they encounter\[1,2,3\].

5.) **Existing Solutions:** How do your users currently address the problem your project aims to solve?

6.) **Familiar Websites:** What websites, applications, and devices are your users already comfortable with\[1,2\]?

7.) **Engaging Features:** Determine which features or functionalities will be valuable or engaging for your users\[2\].

8.) **User’s Devices:** Identify the most popular browsers and devices among your users and ensure your product works well on them\[2\].

9.) **User Feedback:** Plan how to incorporate user feedback into your development cycle.

10.) **Overcoming Barriers:** Consider any potential obstacles that might prevent users from adopting your project and explore ways to address these challenges.

## SUCCESS METRICS:

Setting goals brings clarity to your project, and success metrics are the tools that help you measure these goals\[1,2\]. These metrics could be directly or indirectly connected to your project. For instance, the amount of time users spend on your site (direct) or the quantity of emails you receive from your users (indirect) can serve as good indicators\[1\].  
 It's crucial to remember that your success metrics should relate to areas within your project's influence\[1\]. Choosing metrics that extend beyond your project's control could obscure your impact\[1\].  
 Lastly, always view these metrics in the wider context of your project\[1\]. They should not be interpreted in isolation. External factors that might influence these metrics must also be considered. With these guidelines in mind, your project's success becomes a tangible, measurable target\[1\].

1.) **Project Outcome:** What do you want to get out of making this project? How will you know that you have reached this point?

2.) **Measurements:** What measurements will you use to see if your project is meeting your goals and users needs? Consider common metrics like user engagement, conversion rate, or user retention to track progress\[1,2\].

3.) **Feeling:** How do you want to feel when working on this project, and when this project is over? When can you take time to appreciate and make space for this feeling?

4.) **SMART Goals:** Create some Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound goals for this project. These goals should take no longer than 3 months to achieve. Be open to adjusting these goals as the project progresses and new information becomes available.

5.) **Set Milestones:** Break down your goals into smaller milestones or checkpoints through the project's larger scope. Each milestone should be set in 1 month increments.

6.) **Celebrate Achievements:** How will you acknowledge and celebrate milestones, achievements and successes throughout the project?

_Example Personal Website Success Metrics:_

When I finish this project, I want to have a website that allows me to keep my friends and family up to date on the projects that I am building. I want this website to be more of a conversational piece, rather than a form of marketing. It’s a project, and a personality showcase. I know I will have reached this point when I can send a link and a short message to my mom, and she will be able to see what I am working on.  
 Now the real question is how could I measure this? At first I was thinking about using a metric like newsletter subscribers, or the amount of views each post gets. Then I came to a realization that most of my target audience (friends and family) doesn’t need a newsletter, or keeps up to date with others through a newsletter. They use instagram, snapchat or discord.  
 This realization made me question how I was trying to connect with my friends and family (target audience), and realized that I really need to focus on direct conversation, not some form of conversion. I decided that my success metric would be the amount of times where I _manually_ shared a link to my website when it became relevant in conversation. This is a much harder success metric to track, however it is much more accurate to my main goal for this site, which is having a way to share my projects and stories easier.  
 Of course I will have to make sure that I don’t become ‘that guy with a website who plugs it every 10 minutes’. However, I do find that, when I am reconnecting with extended family, sending a link is a great way to show them what’s going on in my life.

_Example Smart Goal Template:_  
**Specific:** Clearly define your goal, focusing on a specific outcome or result.  
I want to have an up to date website that I can use as a conversation aid when talking with friends and family.\_\_

**Measurable:** Determine how you will track progress and measure the goal's success.  
I will track the number of times I manually share the site in conversation, with a goal to share relevant links 25 times in the next 3 months after the website launch.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Achievable:** Ensure the goal is realistic, consider available resources and constraints.  
I believe that sharing the website 25 times in a 3 month span is achievable.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Relevant:** Ensure that the goal aligns with your project's overall objectives.  
This goal is directly linked to my original purpose of the project.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Time-bound:** Set a deadline for achieving the goal to maintain focus.  
Deadline is 3 months after the website launches.\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Milestones:** Break down the goal into smaller, manageable steps.  
1\. Send a link to the website’s launch 10 times\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
2\. Create and send the first new project link 10 times\_\_\_\_  
3\. Create and send the second new project link 10 times.
