Part III:
Project Structure

Next up, shaping our project's framework! Here, we'll define standards and create a style guide for consistency. We'll also establish an information/data architecture, ensuring every design and feature choice aligns with our vision. Let's lay a cohesive foundation for our project!

SETTING STANDARDS:

Depending on what you value in creating your project, you may want to set standards. Standards are a great way to ensure consistency and quality throughout your project[1]. Even if you prefer to turn out projects quickly, you can find value in setting standards that make you more efficient when making decisions. The level of detail on these standards, and how many of them, are completely up to you.
When writing standards, also frame them positively and focus on what the project should achieve, not what the project should avoid[1]. Standards should also be as specific as possible, so that it is easy to determine if they are met[1].
Standards can be set on nearly any aspect of your project. I prefer to set standards on the visual, content and backend of my project. Making sure that I use a consistent naming convention when writing code and labeling files makes it easy for me to find what I’m looking for later.

1. ) Identify Project Needs: What does this project need to be able to do, look or react like? For example: “This project needs a fast response time, so that the user experience is smooth”. Some projects' needs are less than others[1,2]. Identify a few needs for each of these categories: Functionality, Usability, Aesthetics, Content Quality, Performance, Development.

2.) Quantify Requirements: To transform this need into a requirement, you need to quantify it. Saying "the website should be fast" is subjective and doesn't provide a clear goal to aim for. Instead, use a concrete number. The figure of 400ms is a commonly accepted benchmark for response time, making it a good choice[1,2,3].

Example Personal Website Standards:

Functionality:

- All links should lead to their correct destinations, and be functional.
- All links, buttons and interactions should work on the mobile, tablet and laptop views of the website, as well as 4k displays.

Usability:

- Any interactable feature should have accessibility options.
- All text and images should have good levels of contrast, and are legible at all screen sizes.

Aesthetics:

- All content follows the style guide.

Content Quality:

- All content should be clear and concise.
- A “TLDR” or short summary should accompany any text longer than 300 words.
- All content should be free of spelling and grammar errors.

Performance:

- The website, and all content, should load in less than 2 seconds on a slow 3G connection.
- All animations should play in under 400 ms.
- The website should work on a mobile browser.
  Development:
- All HTML and CSS elements should follow the BEM naming convention.
- A version control system should be used, and in-progress features should not be developed on the published branch.

INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE:

Having the content and information of your project well organized ensures that new users can find what they have come to your project to find. Information Architecture(IA) is the organization of content and information that makes it easy to locate, understand, and use the information available from the project[1,2].  
 IA should be created around the user’s expectations, and be focused on how the user interprets your content[1,2]. Use the same language as your users and avoid using technical jargon or lexicon, unless your users are technically inclined[1,2]. User’s prefer to have clearly defined paths to reaching their goal, even if it takes longer than a shorter messier path[1].
Your project will most likely grow and change over time, so it is important to define an IA that will be flexible enough to change and grow alongside it[1,2].
IA also depends heavily on the context that users’ are navigating the project[2]. For example, users on a mobile device have different expectations on how to navigate a site, as opposed to users on a laptop. Think about the level of stress that users are visiting this site with[2]. If you are trying to provide timely information, don’t make your user sit through the entire story of your family's secret CPR recipe, get to the point and tell them how to use it.

1.) Content Audit: Collect and identify the types of content used in the project. This will include: Text, Images, Videos, etc[1,2].

2.) User's Perspective: What sites does the user already visit? How do they organize their categories? Avoid using acronyms or product numbers as a form of organization. Use the same lexicon of the user, not the salesman[1,2].

3.) Content Organization: Group related content. Sort the content into distinct, descriptive categories, based on user expectations and relevance[1,2].

4.) Use clear labels: Choose clear, descriptive words and phrases for category labels, sticking to commonly used terms[1,2].

5.) Site Structure: Sketch a site map. Show hierarchy and relationship between different sections[1,2].

6.) Navigation Design: Design the main navigation system. Should be easy to use and follow[1,2].

7.) Conduct usability tests: Evaluate users' ability to find items within your information architecture quickly and easily[1,2].

8.) Gather feedback and refine: Collect feedback from users and update your information architecture based on their input, ensuring it remains clear and meets user needs and expectations[1,2].

Example Personal Website Information Architecture:

Content Audit:
Here is a list of all of the content I have already:

- Under 60 second about me
- Project pages:
  - Cadleta.dev project
  - Heatmap Widget Project
  - Goal Bar Project
  - ToDo Runner Project
  - Productivity Bar Project
  - 3D Modeled Chess Project
  - Discord Pin Bot Project
  - Speed Reading Pacer
  - Productivity Bar Old Project
  - System Shut Down Timer
  - Sitting Health Bar Project
- Portfolio:
  - Vector Art
  - Illustrations
  - 3D Models
- Reflection - Monthly reflection with picture and summery of month
- YouTube Museum (Past YouTube Channels)
- Podcast Museum (Past Podcast)

Here is a list of the content I am thinking about adding:

- A "Now" page
- Contact Form
- Work/Resume
- Books Written/Book Resources
- Blog (Personal Stories)
- Video Portfolio
- Software Portfolio
- Book Notes/Reviews
- Live Heatmaps/Chats
- 5 minute about me, mini documentary intro video
- Personal Style Guide
- Personal Manifesto

User’s Perspective:
Here are our 3 types of users:

1.) Friend/Family member: They are familiar with me, and I have probably shared the site with them directly.

2.) Potential clients or employers: They are unfamiliar with me, they have probably found the link to my site on my resume, or through a mutual acquaintance.

3.) Visitor: They have found the website, and are just browsing. Potential found the site from my book, a friend or some other medium.

Content Organization:

- Learn About Me (Under 60 second about me, 5 minute about me, mini documentary intro video, Personal Style Guide, Personal Manifesto)
- View My Work (All project pages, Portfolio, Video Portfolio, Software Portfolio)
- Read My Thoughts (Monthly reflection with picture and summary of month, Blog, Books Written/Book Resources, Book Notes/Reviews)
- Contact Me (Contact Form, Work/Resume)

From here, I decided to re-work the labels and categorization a little bit. This is what I ended up with:

About
Projects
Book(s)
Reflection
Contact

I had the most difficulty figuring out how to organize my various potential written content I wanted to have on the site. I wanted to keep the navigation bar as slim as possible, so I wanted no more than 5 items. Then I had to figure out how to create a category the covers all of this type of content, and whatever else I may want to add to this list:

- Reflections
- Blogs
- Personal Stories
- Book Notes/Reviews

I ended up deciding that I liked the term “Reflection” because it stayed true to what I wanted out of that page, while also remaining fresh. The only problem is that terms like “Blog” or “Articles” are more common, and more likely to be immediately recognizable. I went with my gut on this one. Here is a breakdown of where content will be in relation to these headers:

About:

- About me in under 60 seconds
- “Now” page
- Resume Download
- Link to longer about me
- Maybe a video mini intro at some point
- Links to Personal Manifesto
- Links to Personal Style Guide

Projects:

- Software portfolio
- Video Portfolio
- Art/Creative Portfolio

Book:

- Links to where you can acquire books
- Resources mentioned in the books
- Maybe a long bibliography? Like a list of all of the books I’ve drawn inspiration from?

Reflection:

- Monthly Reflection with pictures
- Blog/Personal stories
- Links to Personal Manifesto
- Links to Personal Style Guide

Contact:

- Contact form
- Resume
- Work experience
- Links to socials

HIGH LEVEL DATA MODELING:
Create a bird’s eye view of your project's data. Create a rough sketch of the different entities in your site and the relationships between them. This will help ensure efficient data management and retrieval in your application[8].

1.) Identify entities: Spot the objects or concepts in your site. Examples could be 'User', 'Post', 'Comment', etc[8].

2.) Define attributes: Identify properties for each entity. For 'User', it could be 'Name', 'Email', etc[8].

3.) Establish relationships: Determine how entities relate. 'User' can have many 'Posts', for instance[8].

4.) Attribute Types: Define the data type for each attribute. 'Email' is a string, 'Age' is an integer.

5.) Determine cardinality: Specify the nature of the relationships between entities, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many[8].

6.) Create a diagram: Visually represent your high-level data model using a diagram, showing entities, attributes, and relationships. This should be a rough sketch, the important part is to get the idea down on paper[8].

6.) Align with MVP: Ensure your high-level data model supports the core features and objectives of your Project's minimum viable Project (MVP).
PROJECT STYLE GUIDE:

We can front load the decision making process to make implementing the design as smooth as possible. The style guide is the collection of all of your design decisions, which helps ensure consistency across the entire project[1]. Style guides traditionally include the standards that affect every aspect of the project, such as the color palettes, typography decisions, and logo uses, however they can also include all of the component level decisions[1].
It is important to strike a balance so that you aren’t turning the style guide into its own project. At its heart, the style guide should only include the level of detail that you need to stay consistent and make yourself more efficient in the long run.

1.) Gather Existing Content: If you have already made some sketches, have any content, or given a branding guide, now is the time to review them.

2.) Review The Holy 3 (Style Guides): There are 3 style guides that take the level of detail to a whole new level. While you will probably not need this level of depth, reviewing these three style guides can give you inspiration for creating your own:

- Google’s Style Guide (https://developers.google.com/style)
- Apple’s Style Guide (https://support.apple.com/guide/applestyleguide/welcome/web)
- Red Hat’s Style Guide (https://redhat-documentation.github.io/supplementary-style-guide/)

  3.) Define Personality: What tone of voice does your project use in writing? What mood does your project extrude? Think about how you want a user to react to your project[3].

  2.) Color: Pick your project colors. Set rules for their use[1,3].

  2.) Typography: Detail the style for all text elements, from headings to body text. Consider alignment, bullet points, and numbered lists[1,3].

  3.) Images/Icons: Outline rules for size, color, and style of images and icons[3].

  4.) UI Elements: Define style for buttons, forms, and cards. Include hover effects and field details[3]. These UI elements may have slight variations that will be used around your project, consider what different modes to include in your style guide.

  5.) Layout/Spacing: Use a grid system for layout. Set rules for margins and padding[3].

  6.) Animations/Timing: Establish rules for animations. This includes duration, easing functions, and delay. Make them consistent across the site for a unified feel[3].

  7.) Navigation: Design navigation elements, considering hover and active states[1,3].

  8.) Responsive Design: Ensure your site adapts well to all device screen sizes[3].

  9.) Code Standards: Include rules for CSS class naming, comment usage, and JavaScript function structure[3].

  10.) Refine: Review your style guide. Modify it as you
  create your website mock-up. Remember, your style guide is dynamic; refine it as your project evolves.

Example Personal Website Style Guide:

I want to embody as much of my personality into my site, and future projects as I can through my style guide. As such, I’ve decided to create and maintain a personal style guide on my website, which will walk through the design choices for my website, and future personal projects. You can find the style guide here:

CREATE WEBSITE CONTENT:

The last thing we have to do to prepare for building the project itself is to gather and create the content[2,3]. While you don’t need to have all of your content together before you start implementing your plans, it is important to have enough content to use as placeholders when designing[2]. Content is not just text; it's also the images, and videos that you plan to include in your project[2].
When creating content, try to understand the purpose of both making and consuming it[1]. You may find that a different format may better suit the purpose behind your content. Don’t just create content, to have content. Think about the reason why you are creating it, or why your user will find it valuable.
Remember that creating and maintaining content can be hard work. Think about how frequently you want to update the different pieces of content in your project. Find ways to streamline the process of creating and publishing the content in your project[1,2].

1.) Purpose: Determine your website's message. What story does it tell? Know this, you'll figure out the content you need.

2.) List Out: Jot down types of content your site needs. Text? Images? Videos? Blogs? A clear list, a clear path[1,2]!

3.) Time & Tools: Understand what creating each content type needs. Got time and tools? If not, find alternatives[2].

4.) Content Sourcing: Where will your content come from? Identify sources such as original writing, third-party resources, or user-generated content[1,2].

5.) Content inventory: Compile a list of all content items, including their types, sources, and categories within the information architecture[1,2].

6.) Consistency: Decide on a tone and style for your content. Consistency makes your website look professional and trustworthy[1,2,7].
7.) Update Content: How often will you review and update your website content? Monitor content regularly to ensure it remains current, engaging, and valuable to users[1,2].

Example Personal Website Content:

Goal Bar:
Pace out your larger goals by focusing on what progress you can make today!

Features:

- Focus on today's progress
- See how much you need to complete to be on track
- Adjust your goal date easily
- See an estimate to completion based on today's progress
- Choose your own colors for each bar of the progress bar
- Show and hide advanced stats about your goal
- Minimalist goal bar view mode

Background:
I haven't always been a goal-oriented person. Over time, and with practice I would set goals and see if I could achieve them. I read that if you write a goal down, its more likely to be achieved. I followed the S.M.A.R.T. goal structure, and learn about stretch goals. I started collecting and experimenting with different ways to look at goal setting and tracking. I started slowly leaning towards a visual way of tracking goals.

[Image of goal notebook]

The second iteration of my visual goal tracker was a paper that I would create and print out at the beginning of every month. It would have that months goals, and the segments that I would need to complete them broken down over the course of the month.

[Image of printed goal sheet]

I used this printed sheet idea for well over a year, until I decided I wanted to use something that would be digital. The problem that I ran into with the printed goal sheet was that I had to design the sheet by hand every month. I would have to measure out each goal, and its subparts in a program designed for digital illustration, not mathy goal bars.
