# Part II: Project Scoping

Now it's time to brainstorm the features that will bring your project to life. We'll outline the specific features your project will offer, and then zone in on the key features that will truly make it stand out. By concentrating on these critical features, we'll define a clear and direct path to accomplishing your project and user goals. Let’s set our sights on some features\!

## TASK FLOW ANALYSIS:

In order to get a complete view of what features our users need, start by understanding the tasks users need to complete\[1,2\]. At this point we already have a pretty clear picture of who our target audience is, and what some of their goals are. So now it is time to break their goals down into the tasks and the steps they need to reach their goals.  
 The best way to better understand your project from the user’s perspective is to walk a mile in their shoes. Walk through the steps that a user must take in order to reach their goal\[1\]. It is very likely that your users’ already have a workflow, or alternative to your project that they use to complete these tasks. You should do research in order to better understand the steps that they currently take\[1,2\]. Take note of the difficult parts of this journey, and look at all of the steps required in order to complete these tasks\[2\]. We will be using this research in order to brainstorm the features that our project needs in order to help users complete these tasks.

1.) **Identify Main Tasks:** What are the main tasks users need to accomplish within your project\[1,2\]?

2.) **Break It Down:** List out the steps that are required to complete the task.

3.) **Determine Order:** What order do the steps need to be taken in order to complete the task\[1,2\]?

4.) **Consider Dependencies:** Identify any sub-tasks that are dependent on one another.

5.) **Decision Points:** Identify the points in the flow that require the users to make a decision\[2\].

6.) **Obstacles:** Think about the challenges users may face going through the task flow\[2\].

7.) **Happy Paths/Unhappy Paths:** Think about what the best case scenario path for a user to take is, and the various ways that users could hit errors or roadblocks\[2\].

8.) **Simplify:** Look for opportunities to simplify or streamline the task flow\[4\].

## BRAINSTORMING FEATURES:

It’s time to brainstorm some features that will meet your users’ goals and complete their tasks. Focus on generating a large quantity of ideas. Give yourself permission to include some of the crazy or impractical ideas now. You will have the opportunity to evaluate these ideas later.  
 A feature is a specific function that your project can perform. The best way to figure out what your project should do is to ask your users\[1\]. In some cases, users will suggest ideas that are good enough for the final version\[1,2\]. Other times, users will try to address a problem, or imagine a solution that can’t be built. In this case, it's best to look at the underlying problem that they are trying to solve through this idea\[1,2\].  
 Sometimes users will talk about a problem they face, or something they really like, which can spark ideas for features they didn’t think of\[1,2\]. Sometimes these ideas can be sparked by people and projects who are not experienced in the field of your project\[1\]. Do some research on other cultures, projects and professions and get an idea of what they use in order to get some new perspective on your current project.

1.) **Personas Needs:** What features do your user personas say they need from your project\[1,2\]?

2.) **Projected Needs:** What features do you think that your users need, or may find useful that they did not mention\[1,2\]?

3.) **Competitors Features:** What features do your competitors have? What features are considered standard practice for this type of project\[2\]?

4.) **Unique Features:** What features make your project distinct from competitors and make your project stand out\[1,2\]?

5.) **Review Research:** Look over the user’s needs as well as the task flows. Look for features that will address key pain points, or be of service to the user.

## BROAD USER STORIES:

We are going to turn your list of brainstormed features into a list of user stories. A user story is a simple, customer-centric description of a feature\[5,6\]. User stories break our feature idea down into a uniformed structure that can help us compare and evaluate features. The structure for a user story is: "As a (user), I want (goal) so that I can (value or why)"\[5,6\]. Breaking down features in this structure ensures that each user story provides a clear value to the user\[5\].  
 Ideally, each user story should be independent of one another, so that one feature can be completed without requiring other features to be completed first\[5\]. Each user story should also be small enough that they can be completed within a few days, in under 16 hours of work\[4,5\].  
 Finally, these user stories are a tool that you can use to get a clear picture of the entire scope of the project's functionality\[6\]. At this stage in the process, these user stories should not have any unnecessary details, and should be flexible enough to change when it comes time to implement the story\[4,5\].

Format: As a _\[type of user\],_ I want _\[an action\]_ so that _\[a value\]._ \[5,6\]

## PRIORITIZING FEATURES:

One of the key struggles of any project is to make sure you are focusing on the right tasks. In this step we are going to evaluate all of our potential features and determine what will provide the most value towards our project and user goals.  
 In order to simplify the evaluation process, we are going to focus on 2 key areas: Importance, and Feasibility\[1,2\]. If a user story is key to reaching one of your project’s goals, or users’ goals, then it is very important\[1,2\]. If a feature is too complicated, too expensive to create or just impossible, then it is not really an achievable target for our project\[1\]. Sometimes there is just not enough time in order to bring a feature idea to life, in which case, you can also just add it to a future version for when you have the time\[1\].  
 When in doubt on how to evaluate a feature, review the goals you set in the project strategy and determine if they align with the larger vision for your project\[1\]. Anything that doesn’t align with the project's vision should be eliminated, or added to an ideas list for a different future project\[1\].

1.) **Assess Features:** For each of your user stories give them a rating of 1 \- 10 in importance and Feasibility. 10 being very important, and very easy to implement, 1 being not important and difficult to implement\[2\].

2.) **Rank Features:** Using the prioritization matrix on the following page, rank the features in terms of importance and feasibility\[2\].

3.) **Review Needs/Goals:** Review the features that are considered high priority and ensure that they will meet all of the user’s needs, and the project's goals.

4.) **Consider Conflicts:** While the project is still mostly theoretical, consider potential rough spots or problems that may arise when building the project. How can you address these considerations? Do you have the skills necessary to create the features?

5.) **Avoid Features:** Which features are either un-important, or too difficult that would distract you from finishing your project? Create a list of features that you will avoid working on until all of the essential features are completed\[1,2\].

## DEFINE THE MINIMAL VIABLE PROJECT (MVP):

It’s time to determine what the smallest, simplest, set of features will meet our most important project’s goals, and users’ needs. Of the list of prioritized features, choose the 20% of features that you think will reach 80% of the goals of the site. Your MVP should be made up of less than 1/4th of all of the features you have brainstormed.  
 The project will change over time, so getting the simplest version done as soon as possible will allow you the flexibility to add and remove backlogged user stories.

1.) **Prioritized Goals:** What are the most important of our user’s needs, and our project goals? What is the core problem that this project is solving? (Think 20% of the goals that solve 80% of the problem)

2.) **Prioritized Features:** What are the features that are in the “Do Now” quadrant of the prioritized user story matrix?

3.) **Check Goals:** Are there any prioritized goals that do not have features mentioned in the list above?

4.) **Remove Unnecessary Features:** Are there any prioritized features that do not directly solve a problem that could be eliminated from our minimal viable product\[4\]?

5.) **MVP Scope:** Create a clear and concise scope for the MVP. This scope should be as simple, and straightforward as possible. Focus only on what is necessary.

_Example Personal Website MVP:_

Of the 36 features(pg 36-37), I have selected 5(14%). I think that these specific goals can meet the majority of my goals(pg 15, 24-25).

## CREATE A PROJECT ROADMAP:

The goal of the project roadmap is about giving yourself permission to _not_ work on certain features and content ideas right now\[1\]. It is too easy to slowly start adding idea after idea onto what you already have planned for your MVP\[1\]. By creating a project roadmap you give yourself permission to include that great idea, _when it's time to,_ and not when you should be focused on creating the simplest and smallest starting point.  
 The other benefit of creating a project roadmap is that you are creating milestones where you can feel like you're making progress, and can step away from the project. Sometimes the best thing you can do is step away from an MVP, and allow yourself a chance to use what you have built. Then return to it after you’ve used it a bunch.

1.) **MVP:** Start by defining the MVP and the features that are required to meet all of the prioritized needs.

2.) **Version 1.5:** What features would increase the value that the MVP brings? What features are needed to meet all of the needs and project goals?

3.) **Version 2+:** What are the features that would add some polish to the project? What are the features that make the project easier to use or more enjoyable to use?
